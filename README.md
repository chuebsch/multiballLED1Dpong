# multiballLED1Dpong
A 3d printed Version of a 1D pong game using Aruino and WS2812B LED strips

## this is inspired by GreatScottLabs [Link](https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Your-Own-1D-Pong-Game/)

I printed the case in 3 main parts. I want to implement single player, two player and a multi ball mode.
